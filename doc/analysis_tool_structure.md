## Analysis tools of N-body simulations using BFE.

- Noise substraction:
    - Principal Basis
    - Signal to noise
    - Cross Validation, entropy

- Plotting routines (include this in Gala):
    - density, acceleration, and potential maps.

- Coefficients visualization (Gala)
- Time dependent analysis:
