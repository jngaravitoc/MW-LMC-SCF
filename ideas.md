- Kathryn: The disk mevement should manifest itself as a m=1 radialy-dependens in the expansion. Still need to separate from the wake?

- Nico: Can we test the amplitude of the "vibrations" in the MW using the BFE. See https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03275
- Robyn S: Using streams to measure how the DM halo is chaning in time following [Buist & Helmi](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00008) see Figure 12.

- Adrian: Build a stellar halo to study the effect of substrucure along the lines of Bullock and Jhonston.
- Build a stellar halo to study the effect of the Wake on the stellar halo.
- Kathryn and more: Chracterize the DM potential from the LMC's DM Wake. 
- Nico: Quantify Chaos in the combine potential?
- Nico: How axion variables look in the time-dependent potential?
- Chervin and others: Apply the BFE in Sgr and the LMC sims.
- Nico: Can we take one of the aquarius halos and add them a disk and an LMC? Using N-body sims? 
- G: Eddie Illsutris Ids the BFE. Compare Illustris halos with ideal simulations. If the BFE expansion works with the Illustris Halos.
- G: Weak lensing talk To Eduardo R. about this. Lensing signal with the LMC. At what radius could weak lensing signals could be contaminating by the LMC.
- G: CMB anisotropy, any component from the LMC.
